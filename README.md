another m0re edit i will use for a week straight then forget about for the next... forseeable future but it exists

90% of code taken from the [miyako edit](https://github.com/tekunotri/miyako)

thx weareallimaginary/quickkennedy for speedometer tools (quickkennedy updated them to work on modern imagemagick)

also somewhat inspired by [cosmicvarietycash m0rehud edit](https://imgur.com/a/cosmicvarietycash-hud-b0cOwUc)
